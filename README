Welcome to the "Space ships" project. It is a simple java project that tries to highlight how to create a simple java astroids application using an object oriented approach.

Any comments? Or suggestions on how to improve the project? Either swing by http://www.ruffythepirate.com/, or send me an e-mail at ake.johan.carlsson@gmail.com. Hope you'll enjoy the code!
